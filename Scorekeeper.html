<h1 id="title">Score Keeper</h1>
<h3 id="ex">Explanation</h3>
<h4 id="ex">This exercise is meant to learn about DOM manipulation.</h5>
<p id="ex">This is a score keeper to keep the score when you're playing a game against someone else so you don't have to memorize it all by yourself. The code isn't DRY yet, that is still to come when I get more training. The sole focus is about how to manipulate a website by writing javascript, adding ID's, calling on functions and having a stop function when a certain point has been reached. I've added a bit of CSS just to keep things interesting, repeating previous excercises and to help me not forget the CSS language.</p>

<div class="pD">
    <h1 class="pDisplay"><span id="p1Display">0</span> - <span id="p2Display">0</span></h1>
</div>

<div class="test">
    <span>This is where we keep the score</span>
</div>

<div class="pD">
    <p>Playing to: <span>5</span></h1> </p>
</div>

<div class="number">
    <input type="number" min = "1">
</div>

<div class="test">
    <span>The max number of games. Use the input box to adjust the max number.</span>
</div>

<div class="buttons">
    <button id="p1">Score Player One</button>
    <button id="p2">Score Player Two</button>
    <button id="reset">Reset</button>
</div>

<div class="test">
    <span>Use the buttons above to mark a score for either player or to reset the score.</span>
</div>

<h3 id="ex">Usage</h3>
<p id="ex">We see the total of both players on top. Ofcourse, it all starts with a blank "0 - 0" score since there hasn't been a game yet. Below that, we see the max number of games that are to be won by a player. The default is set to "5" which means that the first player to win 5 games, has won. To adjust the max numbers, one can adjust the max numbers in the input field below the text. When one edits the max numbers when in a game, a reset will occur, which resets the score back to "0 - 0". On the bottom, we see three buttons: Two buttons to give points to the players and one reset button. When a player gets the maximum amount of wins, the score keeper will end, rendering the "Score" buttons useless and highlighting the winning players score in a green color and the losing players score in red. On pressing the reset button, the score keeper will reset itself and one can start over.</p>
